# Installation

If you have previously scanned QR code and already have `session.json` or `session.data.json` file, it is strongly recommended to rename 'session.json' to 'session.data.json' and copy it into Valor Bot folder/repository.

## Before you start: (necessary)

- Edit owner number `'919971107409'` and replace with own number in `config.js` file
```
global.owner = [
  ['919971107409', 'Dinesh_ValorüáÆüá≥', true]
```
- Edit [X-Team](https://api.xteam.xyz/register) API key `'493053acc612476f'` and replace with own [X-Team](https://api.xteam.xyz/) API key in `config.js` file
```
global.APIKeys = { // APIKey Here
  // 'https://website': 'apikey'
  'https://api.xteam.xyz': '493053acc612476f',
```
> You can also edit and make changes, such as  package name, author name, etc in `config.js` file

## **There are three ways to install:**
